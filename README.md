Stupid Mapreduce Testbed


This project was quickly put together for demonstration purposes. I'm not an experienced web developer, and only had a vey limited time. So yes, this project has a lot of security holes, some features I hven't had the time to implement, etc.

For the installation, probably only the database setup is needed.

Here is a short [demo](https://youtu.be/P5BEcdXxTis), enjoy
